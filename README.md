## Overview of Election Audit
### This is an Election Analysis for my friend Tom using python code to determine the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout.

## Election-Audit Results
A total of 369,711 votes were cast in this congressional election. Denver had the largest county turnout with 306,055 votes following Jefferson County with 38,855 and Arapahoe County with only 24,801. Breaking that down to percentages for each county it would be Denver with 82.8%, Jefferson with 10.5%, and Arapahoe with only 6.7%. The winner of the election was Diana DeGette with a total of 272,892 votes with a winning percentage of 73.8%.

## Election-Audit Summary
This script was very useful to breakdown votes per county and per candidate. You could also use this script in other states or even on a larger scale for the whole United States!
